## Show Finder

Developed using REACT, HTML, Typescript, Jest, react-router and styled-components

This site was developed to use the TVMaze API ( https://www.tvmaze.com/api ) in order to search for shows and see detailed information about them.

For the fetch of each endpoint a custom hook was created to facilitate the process with this REACT project

You can search for them by entering the name of the show in the search box and this will show you a list of all the shows that match that name

If you click on the image for one of these results, you will be taken to the show details route.

From this route you will see a description of the show, the rating for it, a list of the cast members and episodes available, within this episodes section, you can use the dropdown menu to only display episodes from a specific season, this was added because scrolling through all the episodes for a long season made things tedious.
